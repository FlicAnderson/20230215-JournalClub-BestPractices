Bio: 
Currently a PhD Researcher at EPCC, School of Informatics, at the University of Edinburgh, project title: "Coding Smart in Academia: Evidence-Based Software Engineering Approaches for High-Quality Research Software Projects". 
Flic Anderson has been a Research Assistant in Bioinformatics in the Wallace Lab (within the Institute for Cell Biology) at the University of Edinburgh. 
Flic was part of the development team for the 'riboviz' open source software package for processing and analysis of ribosome profiling data, working with colleagues from EPCC (University of Edinburgh) to make the codebase more robust & sustainable.   
With a background in Ecology and Botany (previously a Research Assistant at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh), Flic has worked with a wide range of types of biological data using different software tools and programming languages (particularly R) for the last 8 years, and found herself drawn towards bioinformatics and research software engineering. 
Flic is a member of the Edinburgh Carpentries and a certified Carpentries instructor in foundational coding and data science skills for researchers. 

Title: Best Practices for Scientific Computing 

Abstract:  
Discussion of a key paper in research software engineering which makes recommendations for a set of practices to improve software developed for research, based on authors' experience and teaching, as well as research in the scientific computing and software engineering fields.

## HOW TO (RE-)USE THIS MATERIAL

This is a `.html` presentation created in `R Markdown` with `ioslides`. 

(It's been written in a [.Rmd](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) file, and I generated .html slides by 'knitting' it in Rstudio.)

You can check out the code used to make these slides at the [Talk repo](https://github.com/FlicAnderson/20230215-JournalClub-BestPractices/) on Github, and adapt it for your own presentations if you like - there's a MIT Licence on the repo, which means: 

*"Basically, you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source."*

## Outline 

__Article:__  
- paper format

# The Article 

## Paper Format  

* no abstract / discussion 
* presenting best practice recommendations - these are the key  
* reasonably informal paper  


## introduction / background / research context  

* published 2014  
* RS field back then  
* key papers before this  
* published in PLOS Biology  
* 'scientific computing' vs 'research software'   
* are YOU a research software engineer / researcher-developer?

knitr::include_graphics(c("images/best-practices-1-to-4.png", "images/best-practices-5-to-8.png"))
```  

## Write programs for people, not computers 
* your code needs to _run_ and be _correct_, but also must be **understandable**  
* _beware memory limits_ in users, not just computers: reduce cognitive load!  
* **break up programs** into _task-oriented functions_ or chunks  
* helpful, **descriptive names** -> self documenting & less confusing  
* **consistent_styling_of_code** -> faster reading, fewer errors  

<div class="notes"> 

These days, people are more memory limited than computers: reduce cognitive load!  

Consistency means errors are easier to spot, humans are great at pattern recognition

This slideshow is written in R Markdown, not Latex, as it's easier for a human (e.g. me) to read the text in a markdown doc than a latex one. Also, fewer slashes required :D
</div>



## Let the computer do the work
* repetitive tasks? _Don't try to be a computer_  
* don't fear the **CLI**     
* commonly repeated commands & tasks -> **scripts**     
* combining scripts? Consider a **Workflow Management System\***   
* **store provenance info** (common file formats plz):  
  - raw data IDs, version numbers  
  - _parameter_ values generating specific outputs  
  - _library/program versions_  
* **cite your software!**  

<font size="3">CLI: command line interface; *: WfMS examples: nextflow, snakemake</font>  

<div class="notes"> 
non-computing background folks miss out on 'command history' and repeatability by avoiding CLI :c   

be reproducible - good for research, good for you!
